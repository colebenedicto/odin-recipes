# odin-recipes
First Odin Project!

Project Goals and Expectations (initial)
This Odin Project is to demonstrate/practice what I've learned in this chapter of the course. I will utilize HTML to create a simple, brutalist, probably semi-outdated Recipe Web Page. My goals for this project is to dip my toes on HTML to get a feel in Front-end dev.I think HTML and CSS are important for a sefl-learner like me because, well, I need it to build projects showcasing my back-dev styles.
